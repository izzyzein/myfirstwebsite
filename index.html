                        I do a lot of different kinds of activities from figure skating to cello in a week. I do around 6 classes every week. The class I do the most in the week is Figure skating, which I do for 5 hours a week or more. If you are a person who does multiple classes it can somtimes overlap, like some days after an hour of skating I have cello or sometimes you have to cancel so your class is moved to another day. I would not recommend doing a lot of classes if you have a busy week or you don't have time, because you will use up a lot of energy. Why is it good to do a lot of different clases is because you learn more and it takes you less time to learn things than if you did not do all your clases, also it builds a good work ethic and you won't be very lazy because you're doing something every day no matter what. I think it is a good idea to do multiple classes because you become a more well rounded person and you have more experience in different activities and it's easier find out what you're really good at.
